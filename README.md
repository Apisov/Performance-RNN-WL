# Performance RNN
### Generating Dynamic Polyphonies without Timing Restrictions.

This work is an attempt to reimplement Magenta's [work](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/performance-rnn) using [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language).

Original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/performance_rnn).

Magenta's project has served only as an inspiration and there are no direct reworks 
 from `Python` to `WL`  and from `WL Neural Networks` to `TensorFlow`.
 
_A detailed explanation of the work that has been done here you can read in this [post](http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1380021)_
